    Mimics mutations for a series of parent sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence_mutator_fn : function
        Function that takes a string sequence and an integer, returns a mutated sequence with that many mutations.
    parents : pd.Series
        Series containing parent sequences as strings.

        Series containing the number of substitutions for each parent sequence.

def general_mutator(aa_seq, sub_count, mut_criterion):
    """
    General function to mutate an amino acid sequence based on a criterion function.
    The function first identifies positions in the sequence that satisfy the criterion
    specified by `mut_criterion`. If the number of such positions is less than or equal
    to the number of mutations needed (`sub_count`), then mutations are made at those positions.
    If `sub_count` is greater than the number of positions satisfying the criterion, the function
    mutates all those positions and then randomly selects additional positions to reach `sub_count`
    total mutations. All mutations change the amino acid to a randomly selected new amino acid,
    avoiding a mutation to the same type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    aa_seq : str
        Original amino acid sequence.
    sub_count : int
        Number of substitutions to make.
    mut_criterion : function
        Function that takes a sequence and a position, returns True if position should be mutated.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Mutated amino acid sequence.
