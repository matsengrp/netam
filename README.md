Neural NETworks for antibody Affinity Maturation

## Installation

From a clone of this repository, install using:

    python3.11 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    make install

Note that you should be fine with an earlier version of Python.
We target Python 3.9, but 3.11 is faster.

If you are running one of the experiment repos, such as:

* [thrifty-experiments-1](https://github.com/matsengrp/thrifty-experiments-1/)
* [dnsm-experiments-1](https://github.com/matsengrp/dnsm-experiments-1/)

you will want to visit those repos and follow the installation instructions there.
